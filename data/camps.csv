Serving our guests and making them feel at home is something we want to excel at, and providing adequate food options is one way to do that. Our goal is to ALWAYS have SOME offerings in this area. However, the resources we have as a truly non-­‐profit facility, serving thousands of people with various needs, are limited. So it's important for us to be clear about what items we can and cannot offer our guests in terms of special food items. Please take a moment to read the following information and let us know if you have any further questions. We look forward to serving you in this area! TIMELY COMMUNICATION The first thing that helps us serve you best is the timely relay of important information. Please be sure to submit a list of your group’s dietary needs at least 2 weeks before you arrive at CAW (the contract says 30 days, but we know there are always last minute registrations being submitted within that timeframe). Requests that are submitted less than 2 weeks prior to arrival may not be possible to accommodate. SEVERE FOOD ALLERGIES Safety is of utmost importance, so our kitchen is happy to avoid serving food items that may cause a life threatening anaphylactic reaction while your group is here. However, we cannot guarantee that contamination from an outside source is avoided. EXAMPLE: If one of your campers is severely allergic to peanuts/tree nuts, we will avoid cooking/preparing any item with those ingredients. However, many products are made/processed in factories where nuts are also prepared (flour, oatmeal, etc), so residual contamination may be an issue depending on the severity of a camper’s allergy. What we CAN provide: In addition to accommodating severe, life-­‐threatening allergies, our kitchen is typically able to provide some alternative items for people with the following restrictions: ~ Vegetarian ~ Dairy/Lactose Free ~ Gluten Free When a group notifies us, at least 2 weeks before arrival, of the number of guests with any of the above 3 allergies/restrictions, we are able to provide a few supplemental items at each meal, such as: ~ Soy/Almond/Lactose-­‐free Milk ~ Meat-­‐free substitutions ~ Gluten Free Bread & Pasta ~ Gluten Free & Dairy Free Desserts CAW Special Dietary Needs Policy We prepare and serve a full salad bar at each lunch and dinner, as well as numerous side options. Most of our buffet items are served in a way that people can ""build"" their own meals, choosing only the items they know they can eat safely. When that is not possible, we do what we can to provide a few alternatives for those with the above 3 allergies/restrictions. If a guest’s diet require more alternatives, that guest is welcome to bring some additional supplemental items. If you have dietary needs beyond these 3 allergies/restrictions, or you feel more comfortable providing some of your own individual supplements, then we are happy to provide refrigerated storage space for the supplemental food you bring/provide. Our dining hall is equipped with a microwave and refrigerator/freezer that is accessible at any time. If you would like a copy of our intended menu for the dates you will be staying at CAW, we are happy to email it to you a few days before your arrival. We reserve the right to make last-­‐minute changes depending on product availability and fluctuation in guest numbers. If you have specific menu/meal items that you would like to be served to your whole group, we will do our best to accommodate your request – as long as we receive such requests at least 30 days before your contracted arrival to CAW. What we CANNOT provide: We are not able to guarantee that our kitchen is completely free of contaminants, such as gluten, soy, dairy, sugar, etc. If one of your campers is severely affected by any of these contaminants, it is best that they provide their own supplemental food. Our kitchen staff cannot be responsible for preparing any food items that are provided by a guest unless it pertains to the above 3 allergies/restrictions. While we are happy to provide your Guest Group Leader with some food labels so they can help children avoid certain items, we do not have the staff resources to provide alternative options for people with specific dietary needs or preferences outside of the following 3 allergies/restrictions: ~ Vegetarian ~ Dairy/Lactose Free ~ Gluten Free Candy and snack items sold from our Canteen/Snack Shack may also contain allergens. We are not able to monitor which items are sold to, or should be avoided by, guests & campers. If your group has scheduled time for this activity, please inform people with dietary restrictions of the risk and their responsibility in making healthy purchases.",No,,"More than 3/less than all sleeping units, Toilets, Showers, Dining hall, Campfire space(s)",Would need more information to determine,,,"All sleeping units, Dining hall, Bathroom facilities","Plumbed toilets in separate bathroom facility, Plumbed toilets in sleeping unit, Showers in separate bathroom facility, Showers in sleeping unit",,"Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall",,Yes,,"Ropes course, Pool, Forested areas, Meadowland, Trails",Campfire space(s),"3 campfires, between 40-150","Access to water (lake, pond, river, stream, etc.)",Salmon River,,,Other amenities/resources,full size indoor gymnasium,,,,,,"Alice Ott Middle School – Portland, Arleta K-8 School – Portland, Clear Creek Middle School – Gresham, Da Vinci Middle School – Portland, Hosford Middle School – Portland, North Marion Middle School – Aurora, St John Fisher – Portland, The Madeleine Elementary School – Portland, West Orient Middle School – Gresham, West Sylvan Middle School – Portland, Corbett Middle School – Corbett, Creative Science School – Portland, Deep Creek K-8 School – Damascus, Roseway Heights School – Portland, St Therese School – Portland, All Saints School – Portland, Holy Redeemer Catholic School – Portland, Arata Creek School – Troutdale, Access Academy – Portland, Astor Elementary School – Portland, Beverly Cleary School – Portland, Boise-Eliot Elementary School – Portland, Faubion Elementary School – Portland, George Middle School – Portland, Lane Middle School – Portland, Lent Elementary School – Portland, Mt Tabor Middle School – Portland, Ockley Green Middle School – Portland, Scott Elementary School – Portland, Sellwood Middle School – Portland, Winterhaven School – Portland, Ron Russell Middle School – Portland",,-121.9763618,45.3479342,Rigler Elementary School – Portland

This camp facility was generously donated to our nonprofit organization very recently, in May of 2014, and we are currently working to get the facility up and running again and make it available to schools for outdoor educational camps. Currently, our land use has reverted to F2 (farming and forestry) and our understanding is that we are only legally permitted to host day camps at this time. We are working to re-establish the original nonconforming use permit for camps, conferences and retreats or acquire a new conforming use permit to operate as a youth camp, so that we can offer this facility for overnight camps and retreats. Any resources to aid us in this process are greatly appreciated! We have an extensive facility with much to offer, and we have been informed by the county that this is the second-best retreat center in Oregon, so we see a lot of potential here and are looking forward to collaborating with various different groups to help make it available as a resource for educating and empowering the next generation of earth stewards.",Unknown,Meghan Machado; meghan@circleofchildren.org,,"""Campsites, no commercial kitchen""",,,-123.5759187,44.1661071,
