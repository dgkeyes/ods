It is incredible valuable for students to have the experience of seeing and looking into an environment they don't often look into. However, I also believe the outdoor school programs we have attended through NWRSED seem to focus too much on the learning of too many small factoids that, while relevant to the outdoor location and our middle school standards, I could teach students in the class. I think their program could benefit from a shift in focus towards observation and inquiry into the environment around them. I've spent most of my professional career working with students in the natural world from time to time, often with kids who never go outdoors. Really, when students head into these unfamiliar environments for the first time, they need the time to slow down and observe what is around them. A good program, in my mind, structures for that. Less transitioning from place to place, and longer time to observe, journal, communicate observations, develop inquiry into the natural world based on those questions and observations, collect data, make comparisons, and draw conclusions. 

That being said, I don't want to downplay how good of a job the NWRESD staff does at engaging students and keeping them interested throughout the week. My students always return with positive views of their experience and having learned more than they arrived at camp with. I just think as a science instructor, I see a wonderful opportunity in outdoor school for students to think like a scientist working in the field things, and believe the programming the state promotes should develop with focused attention on the inquiry and engineering standards, not content specific facts. I also think we as science teachers could do a lot of content specific prep to build some initial background knowledge so students arrive at camp. If the camps could provide that to us beforehand, then students would have a content foundation to build inquiry around.",,657,662,362,54.7%,300,45.3%,1,0.2%,36,5.4%,,0%,10,1.5%,30,4.5%,550,83.1%,35,5.3%,,,,,,,225,213,224,,,,,true,"Stafford Primary – West Linn, Willamette Primary School – West Linn",-122.7064859,45.3776918,,

As part of our 7th & 8th grade science curricula and goals, hands-on and real-life exposure to the natural world are an essential part of educational programs.  Our students and all students need exposure to being out in nature and not just reading about it in the classroom. We were very pleased with the opening of Camp Gray, since the ""camping"" at South Beach State Park was quite an adventure for the staff to pull off every other year when we not going to the Hancock Field Station.  Our only regret is that the programs at the Hatfield Marine Science Center were more academic that the one's at Camp Gray.  Also, many of the choices at Camp Gray were the same as the Hancock Field Station, so we were a little limited as to what our students would do.
