"1","Agia Sophia Academy – Beaverton","We are a small school - 50 students total.  We'd love to partner with other small schools to make outdoor school affordable / possible for us :)"
"2","Albany Christian School – Albany","I don't really know a whole lot about it."
"3","Aloha-Huber Park School – Aloha","ODS has been a very important program to our schooI. It offers unique and enriching opportunities to our high poverty, culturally diverse, and high achieving student population. It is among the most memorable experiences for our students when they graduate."
"4","Alsea Elementary School – Alsea","Our organization has worked well for 26 years and made changes as the need has arisen.  We are meeting this summer to make sure more of our classes meet standards and doing some tweaking if necessary as we have done for years.  We hope that we don't have somebody come in and tell us we must change our system.  We have a pretty strong team of six schools who have worked well together for many years.  Please feel free to call, if you would like more information or if I can answer questions."
"5","Amity Elementary School – Amity","I have directed our program for over 20 years and see it as highly successful and valuable as a part of our educational program.  I am excited that there may be help funding the program as our students fundraise the total cost for our program."
"6","Applegate Elementary School – Eugene","This would be nice if funding is available and the time to organize the activity."
"7","Athey Creek Middle School – West Linn","I really appreciate the opportunity for students to attend outdoor school. It is incredible valuable for students to have the experience of seeing and looking into an environment they don't often look into. However, I also believe the outdoor school programs we have attended through NWRSED seem to focus too much on the learning of too many small factoids that, while relevant to the outdoor location and our middle school standards, I could teach students in the class. I think their program could benefit from a shift in focus towards observation and inquiry into the environment around them. I've spent most of my professional career working with students in the natural world from time to time, often with kids who never go outdoors. Really, when students head into these unfamiliar environments for the first time, they need the time to slow down and observe what is around them. A good program, in my mind, structures for that. Less transitioning from place to place, and longer time to observe, journal, communicate observations, develop inquiry into the natural world based on those questions and observations, collect data, make comparisons, and draw conclusions. 

That being said, I don't want to downplay how good of a job the NWRESD staff does at engaging students and keeping them interested throughout the week. My students always return with positive views of their experience and having learned more than they arrived at camp with. I just think as a science instructor, I see a wonderful opportunity in outdoor school for students to think like a scientist working in the field things, and believe the programming the state promotes should develop with focused attention on the inquiry and engineering standards, not content specific facts. I also think we as science teachers could do a lot of content specific prep to build some initial background knowledge so students arrive at camp. If the camps could provide that to us beforehand, then students would have a content foundation to build inquiry around."
"8","Banks Elementary School – Banks","Great program for kids, improvement is needed in the recruitment and training of high quality high school counselors. High school teachers could be more supportive in encouraging quality students to miss a week of class to volunteer at outdoor school."
"9","Bethany Charter School – Silverton","This year we are attending Camp Macgruder in Rockaway Beach"
"10","Black Butte Elementary School – Camp Sherman","We do many components of outdoor school all year long including hiking, camping, teambuilding, and experiential adventures. Outdoor school shouldn't just be a 3 day experience. It can happen all year long."
"11","Bridgeport Elementary School – Tualatin","Typically has been a 6th grade adventure, not 5th in TTSD."
"12","Butte Creek Elementary School – Mt Angel","We've worked very hard over the years to provide an ODS experience at very little to no cost to families, so we appreciate what it provides our students."
"13","Cascades Academy – Bend","As an independent school with an experiential model, our program includes activities similar to ODS that we plan and implement. Our students go on traveling school annually beginning in 2nd grade, bi-annually beginning in 4th grade. We also do a day ""outdoor school"" program in the spring for all of our lower school students PK-5th. 
***
Speaking entirely personally for a moment, I grew up in Tillamook with fantastic ODS experiences, both as a camper, and as a repeat high school counselor. I am so grateful that there are people in the state committed to continuing these opportunities for future generations of Oregonians."
"14","Cedarwood Waldorf School – Portland","We love Outdoor School!"
"15","Cobb School – Roseburg","Extremely positive for both the kids and the teachers.  They love that someone else is organizing it."
"16","Colonel Wright Elementary School – The Dalles","We have used Outdoor School as a district in the past for a TAG program activity.  It is always well-received.  We did it for about 5 years.  We stopped last  year as a cost-cutting item.  It would be great to bring it back."
"17","Conestoga Middle School – Beaverton","We absolutely love it.  The experiences our kids get can't be simulated in the classroom.  That is why we write grants, fund raise, beg and borrow to be able to get our kids the experience.  Teachers at our school spend countless unpaid hours planning and organizing.  It would be great to have the State's help and funding."
"18","Creative Science School – Portland","Huge benefit for students - so glad it's fully funded again"
"19","Creswell Middle School – Creswell","Outdoor School is great.  We just don't have the interest in it at this time. Maybe in the next few years."
"20","Culver Middle School – Culver","If the measure passed, when will we see funding support?"
"21","Danebo Elementary School – Eugene","It is an amazing experience for our students. We partner with another school in our District and together take about 130 students. We are looking forward to the potential funding for future years instead of having to raise the funds on our own."
"22","Dexter McCarty Middle School – Gresham","no"
"23","Dufur School – Dufur","We know Condon already has a program set up that is done in conjunction with other schools. It would be great if we could join forces as small schools and do a nice big program together."
"24","Eagle Point Middle School – Eagle Point","Outdoor School is a tremendous experience for so many kids!"
"25","East Elementary School – Tillamook","ODS has been a long time standing tradition in our district. We are providing this service for Santiam in Mills City also (they attend with us). This upcoming year, we plan to extend our program to 4 nights 5 days again. We have been very thankful to have the support of the Gray's Family foundation, and hope that we will once again this year. Thank you for taking the time to learn about us. We would love to answer any questions you would have."
"26","Edgewood Community Elementary School – Eugene","The loss of your funding has really hurt us, and our ability to attend Outdoor School. Our district has not applied for the funds from Measure 99, and without your grant, we are scrambling to find ways to fund next year's trip."
"27","Elmira Elementary School – Elmira","We run a great program. It has been fine tuned over the years and runs well!"
"28","Englewood Elementary School – Salem","An overnight program will probably not work with my teachers"
"29","Ferguson Elementary School – Klamath Falls","I love that our students from Klamath Falls are able to experience the beach, for many, it is the first or second time ever.  I think it is very important to take students to a different environment than where they live to experience new things.  Outdoor School is also the most science that students get in their elementary years.  Funding is our biggest challenge.  We do fundraisers every year to help and we scholarship students.  We don't leave anyone behind because they can't afford it but it is hard because Ferguson is a high poverty school.  However, the experience these kids have is worth it.  I am very appreciative of the NW Regional Education Service District for letting us come."
"30","Fir Grove Elementary School – Beaverton","Beaverton School District sends 6th graders to ODS."
"31","Fleming Middle School – Grants Pass","It is very difficult to pull off without the correct supervision and assistance."
"32","Forest Grove Community School – Forest Grove","It's an essential part of our program and should be for all students in Oregon!"
"33","Fossil Charter School – Fossil","We have two new teachers this year in our 1/2 and 3/4 blended classes. They have both requested funds for a modified outdoor school opportunity for the kids but due to lack of funds, we have had to deny the request.  This is where we would like to develop our own program so the kids could go out on one or two day Outdoor School experiences."
"34","Frenchglen Elementary School – Frenchglen","Outdoor School for this small school would depend on if multiple grades including those outside of 5 or 6 are allowed to attend."
"35","Gaarde Christian School – Tigard","Due to our being a private school, with small class sizes, we were not able to gain information about Outdoor School programs. We have created our own, in a sense, with parent funding, though."
"36","Gardiner Middle School – Oregon City","Oregon City has been committed to ODS! We have offered ODS to the 6th graders in Oregon City through all of the economic storms. The Gray Family Foundation has helped make that happen for us. Thank you. ... Curious about hot Grant Funding will work. We relied on Gray Family Foundation, who will not be funding this year. That likely means greatly increasing our fees to students (which we currently charge $125 of the $214 we are billed by NW Regional ESD)."
"37","Grande Ronde Academy – La Grande","I would like more information on OSU extension service opportunities. We did have help from Mike Weddle with JGEMS grants for funding and coordination for current years program. Past years have been organized with staff and parent experts and local experts in area."
"38","Grandhaven Elementary School – McMinnville","Last year was the first year that our school did Outdoor School.  We were able to raise funds and provided a 2 day stay at the new OMSI Camp Gray in Newport.   We were so impressed we worked to increase the duration of the Outdoor School at OMSI Camp Gray to 3 days.  This year we did our state assessment for 5th grade Science before the camp, and then did the second round after the camp, and noticed that the students' scores went up significantly.  We asked the students who had already met to take it again after the camp and most moved to exceeded."
"39","Gray Middle School – Portland","It is by far the best experience of all for grade 6."
"40","Green Acres School – Lebanon","6th grade students in our district attend Outdoor School. As we are a K-5 school we do not send students."
"41","Groner K-8 – Hillsboro","It's an amazing experience for ALL students!"
"42","Hanby Middle School – Gold Hill","I had to combine day and night for the three trips we take. 6th and 7th graders have a two day and 1 night experience. 8th graders have a 3 night four day trip in the fall and a different group of 8th graders do a 4 night 5 day trip in the spring."
"43","Helman Elementary School – Ashland","Our 5th graders participate in a teacher planned and run 3-day overnight outdoor school field trip.  We may be interested in expanding to a full week, but traditionally we've had the 3-day field trip."
"44","Henley Elementary School – Klamath Falls","We have received correspondence from the NWRESD recently informing us that at this time, full state funding for 2017-18 ODS is not going to be available. concerned about how implementation will affect 2017-18 school year plans"
"45","Highland School at Kenwood Elementary School – Bend","Our school plans to return to a ""Boot Camp"" experience rather than the outdoor school at Camp Tamarack next year.  It will only be for one night and it's entirely run by teachers and parent volunteers."
"46","Hood River Middle School – Hood River","I am very interested in understanding how we can access monies starting next year for ODS.  Thanks!"
"47","Hoover Elementary School – Corvallis","I hope we have someone to plan and coordinate this in the future. We had a parent committee organize and coordinate everything and as a full time teacher, I couldn't have done it without them. They will not be here next year and I don't know how I'll be able to get everything organized. It's a full time job!"
"48","Horizon Christian School – Hood River","I am so thankful that voters approved measure 99 which shows that they understand the value of the ODS experience.  I am eager to hear if the measure will be interpreted to include private schools in the funding.  Fingers crossed!  Our students will greatly benefit too."
"49","Irrigon Elementary School – Irrigon","Outdoor School has been a priceless opportunity and experience for our students."
"50","Irvington Elementary School – Portland","Our school community loves the opportunity to attend!"
"51","Jefferson Middle School – Jefferson","It is considered by staff and community as an important component of our 6th grade curriculum"
"52","John McLoughlin Elementary School – Oregon City","Outdoor school is an valuable learning experience for the 6th grade students in Oregon City."
"53","Kings Valley Charter School – Philomath","We were so appreciative of the foundations help."
"54","Lacomb School – Lebanon","Outdoor School is such an important part of a student's education; I've had such positive experiences with it and my students gain both educationally and socially.  The Gray Family Foundation has been an important part of investing in the success of our Forest Camp and I'm grateful for their support!"
"55","Lewelling Elementary School – Milwaukie","I loved Outdoor School and I am a strong supporter of all kids getting this experience. As a school district, we have decided that all of our 6th graders will attend."
"56","Liberty Elementary School – Albany","Our school is grades K-5.  I believe the district plan is to look at Outdoor School as a 6th grade experience."
"57","Lincoln City Seventh-Day Adventist School – Lincoln City","Unsure how many years our school has participated. It's been at least 4."
"58","London School – Cottage Grove","I have been involved in Outdoor School for 14 years, and I absolutely love it! I believe it is very necessary for our students to experience this as I have seen first hand how this affects students in such a positive way."
"59","Lookingglass Elementary School – Roseburg","Help in funding would be great. Our district does not contribute any funds for the program. Students and families do all of the fundraising to support their trip. $260 per student."
"60","Luckiamute Valley Charter School – Monmouth","As far as I know our school has participate in Outdoor School for the last 4 years. It may have been longer."
"61","Mabel Rush Elementary School – Newberg","This is a great program and needs to be funded at a level that supports all students in attending.  Three days is enough though.  One whole week would be too much to ask of parent volunteers and teachers who would have to be away from their families, jobs, etc."
"62","Malin Elementary School – Malin","I want to be able to take our students to any outdoor school we choose."
"63","Mari-Linn Elementary School – Lyons","We highly value the outdoor school experience."
"64","Martin Luther King Jr. School – Portland","We love it and it has a great impact"
"65","Maupin Elementary School – Maupin","All kids need hands on, fun outdoor experiences that encourage them to take better care of our earth and builds on their interests in the outdoors. The easiest way to ensure kids become passionate about saving and taking care of our Earth and everything on it is to get them to fall in love with it. People don't distory what they love, they distroy what they don't know and/or hate."
"66","McBride Elementary School – St Helens","Best program!  This is so good for students.  In Multnomah County, where I taught sixth grade for over 20 years, we took students to a program Sunday-Friday.  In my opinion, that should be for all students."
"67","McGovern Elementary School – Winston","The 6th grade team has been putting together an outdoor program for our students for the past several years.  While we really appreciate all the benefits our students receive, it is a lot of work to put together.  It would be nice to receive asstance in the form of ideas,  presenters and money.
Thank You
Donna Rexford"
"68","McKay Creek Elementary School – Pendleton","Outdoor school happens in 6th grade in our district.  6th grade is at our Middle School. Our elementary schools will NOT participate in outdoor school.  We have day trips to connect with wetland projects."
"69","Meadow Park Middle School – Beaverton","I'm curious on how they will determine who is going to be going for Fall 2017 and Spring 2018.  Also, what assessments are required for school participating. Please feel free to contact me if you have further questions.

"74","Muddy Creek Charter School – Corvallis","Muddy Creek Charter School is sponsored by the Corvallis School District, not Philomath, as indicated in you list of schools.
Information from the ODE, Extension and our sponsoring District (Corvallis) has been minimal. It would be helpful to be sure Charter Schools are looped in to all communication."

"76","Northwest Chinese Academy – Portland","As a Mandarin Immersion school we would need the program to be conducted in Mandarin to meet with our school mission."
"77","Oak Creek Elementary School – Lake Oswego","I am currently a principal.  I used to teach.  I highly, highly valued outdoor school and took 5th graders to Opal Creek for two nights several years.  I am unsure how open this community would be to taking students to outdoor school in fifth grade.  We have a native plant garden and a food garden here, I would love to see students go to somewhere like Opal Creek.  I am open to discussion with my staff and parents about this.  I think Outdoor school is essential for children. I am a huge advocate for it and love the book by Louv, The Last Child in the Woods.  I support your work!  Thanks for doing this research."
"78","Oregon School for the Deaf – Salem","Because of the communication needs of all of our students, we conduct a wonderful program using Camp Taloali every year, to ensure our students have a similar experience, yet using our staff who use ASL directly."
"79","Pacific Crest Middle School – Bend","I would love to see Outdoor School become a 6th grade event. Middle school is a tough transition for many students and there are numerous elementary schools that blend into one middle school. Outdoor School would be an ideal setting for a 6th grade class to unify and bond. 

In addition, it was a very positive experience for our 8th grade students to train as Jr. Student Leaders. This is a program that I would like to continue and expand upon."
"80","Plush Elementary School – Plush","It's important for kids to be outside.  One time, we took our kids to a formal outdoor school on the coast.  We try to get around the state in four years.  It rained the entire time, we are desert kids.  It was really formal, it was a different experience but the kids loved it."
"81","Portland Jewish Academy – Portland","We love it and our kids have a great time!"
"82","Prescott Elementary School – Portland","We have not participated because it is a rite of passage in 6th grade to attend."
"83","Raleigh Hills Elementary School – Portland","none"
"84","REALMS (Rimrock Expeditionary Alternative Learning Middle School) – Bend","We have a very strong outdoor fieldwork program at REALMS that is woven into our classroom curriculum and mission of our school. While we do not go out to a traditional ""outdoor school"" experience, every one of our 150 students completes significant day and overnight fieldwork experiences each year and most are connected to stewardship and environmental sciecne outdoors. 6th graders spend 7 days in the field each year, 7th graders spend 13 days, and 8th graders over 20. We would OVE more funding for this work, but a traditional somewhat ""isolated"" outdoor school experience is not what we are shooting for pedagogically. For more info, see our EL portfolio at el.friendsofrealms.org"

"86","River Road / El Camino del Río Elementary School – Eugene","Get the legislator to fund outdoor school."
"87","Roosevelt Elementary School – Klamath Falls","Our students love love it.  Year after year, when our 5th graders transition to Pondo Middle School they say their favorite part of attending Roosevelt is Science Outdoor School.  Teachers make such amazing relationships with students.  
I have attended for the day and a night as well.  I helped with the Night Hikes, etc.  So much learning happens that wouldn't have happened in the classroom.
Great experience for kids!"
"88","Roseway Heights School – Portland","We really enjoy it."
"89","Sacred Heart Catholic School – Gervais","Outdoor School has always been one of the most valuable experiences all 6th graders experience through Sacred Heart Catholic School."
"90","Sauvie Island Academy – Portland","This is a crucial experience for students and even though we have a very limited budget, we work to find the funds to make it happen for our kids. It would be amazing to think that all students would get to have this opportunity in our state."
"91","Scenic Middle School – Central Point","Funding would  be the only reason we would not be able to implement an outdoor program."

"94","South Middle School – Grants Pass","We need info about how to access Measure 99 funds."
"95","Springville K-8 School – Beaverton","ODS is an awesome educational component. I wish the measure passed would fund it. I wish it was for 5th graders instead of 6th graders. We are unable to go next year because of it."
"96","St Agatha Catholic School – Portland","We would love to receive funding to be able to make outdoor school more affordable to our families and to help supplement those with significant financial needs. 

I also typed ""20"" years for sending students to outdoor school because it required a number- I'm not sure the exact number but I know this school has sent students to outdoor school for many years."
"97","St Helens Arthur Academy – St Helens","Being a Charter School, in which receive considerable less funding than District Schools, we rely on Parent fundraising to raise half the cost of ODS.  We would not be able to afford to send our students, even for a 3 day event, if we did not have this additional funding source.  It is very difficult to provide funding for even half.

It is difficult to overstate how wonderful, on all levels, the ODS program has been for our student these past 8 years we have participated.

Thank you for your attention to ODS. It is important."
"98","St John The Baptist Catholic School – Milwaukie","I would love to find out more information regarding a more ""traditional"" outdoor school experience.  Being a small private school in North Clackamas, we are not eligible for any type of funding, so we have generally gone with OMSI's shorter and lesser expensive programming."
"99","St Marys School – Medford","As a private, Catholic school, I do not believe we qualify for Measure 99 lottery funds.  Even if we did, our outdoor program offerings are offered in-house.   Right now, we have no plans to make use of an ""outdoor school"" that is external to our organization."
"100","St Stephens Academy – Beaverton","During the 5 years our school has had ""Outdoor School"", we have sent our 7th & 8th grade students to OMSI--Hancock Field Station--twice, Camp Gray--once (this spring), and have camped at South Beach State Park and taken our students for classes and activities at the Hatfield Marine Science Center.

As part of our 7th & 8th grade science curricula and goals, hands-on and real-life exposure to the natural world are an essential part of educational programs.  Our students and all students need exposure to being out in nature and not just reading about it in the classroom. We were very pleased with the opening of Camp Gray, since the ""camping"" at South Beach State Park was quite an adventure for the staff to pull off every other year when we not going to the Hancock Field Station.  Our only regret is that the programs at the Hatfield Marine Science Center were more academic that the one's at Camp Gray.  Also, many of the choices at Camp Gray were the same as the Hancock Field Station, so we were a little limited as to what our students would do.

Overall, it is a wonderful opportunity and experience for students to go to camp and be in the environment that they are learning about."
"101","St Therese School – Portland","We love it and think it is vital to all our students!"
"102","St Thomas Academy – Redmond","We are currently an ONREP school and we are private so the 1 week outdoor school doesn't apply to us.  We have many experiential lessons and field trips that are learned outside the classroom because of ONREP."

"104","Stearns Elementary School – Klamath Falls","I am wondering if OSU extension will have their program set up for outdoor school in the 2017-2018 school year?

The number of years may be greater than ten, I have only been here for 5 and I know they have been doing outdoor school much longer than that."
"113","Terrebonne Community School – Terrebonne","I think this is important for many reasons for kids to take part in this experience.  I am disappointed that Measure 99 was billed as a way to pay for this, however it was an unfunded mandate and there is still no substantive way to pay for it yet without taking from other programs.  Where then does the money come from?  I work in a high poverty school and we charge 100 dollars for those that can pay.  In my current format it is cost prohibitive and there is potential from year to year we cannot cover the cost of the program."

"117","Umpqua Valley Christian School – Roseburg","We are a Christian school and therefore teach science for a Christian perspective.

"125","Willowcreek Elementary School – Vale","We need to make outdoor school an option for the kids in Eastern Oregon!"
"126","Wilson Elementary School – Corvallis","Our program for many years was run by teachers 5 days at Camp Kiwanalong, but it was a challenge to plan meals, hire lifeguards, coordinate curriculum, etc... working with OMSI will be more sustainable, but I would like to increase to the 4 or 5 day program. It was more inclusive this year with going to Newport which is closer to Corvallis.  Example, some kids came for the day. The principal (me) was able to join for an evening. This was difficult when up in Astoria, although the museums were great!"
"127","Woodburn Arthur Academy – Woodburn","No, but I was impressed that the survey did only take 5 or less minutes.  Usually they say only 5 minutes but the next time you look at your watch 15 to 20 minutes have passed."
