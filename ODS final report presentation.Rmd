# How do Schools Create Successful Outdoor School Programs? {.section-title .successful-programs .ods-blue}



## Need for multilevel support {.ods-blue}

- Teachers
- Administrators
- District
- Families
- Community

## Teachers: Fundraising has been a big issue {.ods-blue}
<blockquote>In Vale, a small town in Eastern Oregon, Willowcreek Elementary School raises money by recycling cans. Their four-day, three-night Outdoor School program at McCall Outdoor Science School in Idaho, is funded, as teacher Marti Bair put it, “five cents at a time.”</blockquote>

## Organizing the logistics for Outdoor School is a huge task {.ods-blue}

<blockquote>“Teachers at our school spend countless unpaid hours planning and organizing.”</blockquote> 

Ashley Wilson, sixth grade teacher at Conestoga Middle School in Beaverton

## Many schools outsource curriculum development to reduce burden on teachers {.ods-blue}

<blockquote>“I can’t imagine if I had to plan curriculum too.”</blockquote>
Fifth grade teacher Beth Fuhrer at Grandhaven Elementary School in McMinville 

## Teachers have to be willing to spend several days away from their families to participate in Outdoor School {.ods-blue}
<blockquote>Brian Kissell, principal of Highland School in Bend, spoke of being incredibly appreciative of his teachers, who are willing to do what it takes to support their school’s Outdoor School program. A school where he previously worked did not have such support from the teaching staff, and he saw teachers “get bent out of shape” as a result of feeling forced to be involved with Outdoor School.</blockquote>


## Administrators {.ods-blue}

Up to this point, in places without a district-wide Outdoor School policy, they have often been the ones who decide whether or not to participate


## Without district support, even administrators supportive of Outdoor School may not know how to get their schools involved {.ods-blue}

<blockquote>“I don’t think anybody I work with even knows that I’m a passionate Outdoor School supporter.”</blockquote>

## Many families are eager to be involved in Outdoor School {.ods-blue}

## There are often particular reasons why other families may be hesitant to allow their children to participate in Outdoor School {.ods-blue}

# Conclusion {.section-title .conclusion}


## Main takeaways {.ods-blue}

- In the 2016-2017 school year, over 30,000 students participated in Outdoor School.
- Nearly two-thirds of schools participated in Outdoor School in 2016-2017.
- No observable differences with regard to race and Outdoor School participation.
- High-poverty schools are less likely to participate in Outdoor School. 


## Main takeaways {.ods-blue}

- Ninety-five percent of Outdoor School programs have an academic component that connects to state standards.
- The most common length of Outdoor School programs is three days and two nights.
- Outdoor School programs were held at 38 camps in 2016-2017, the vast majority of which were in Northwestern and Central Oregon. 
- Most Outdoor School programs have existed for 10 years or less.


## Main takeaways {.ods-blue}

- Successful Outdoor School programs receive multilevel support from teachers, administrators, districts, and communities. 
- Over half of schools that do not currently participate in Outdoor School are very or somewhat interested in starting programs.
- There is significant confusion among schools about Measure 99.  



## The challenge in funding Outdoor School for all is great {.ods-blue}
- There is a lot of confusion about Measure 99.
- Create a funding structure that works for the diversity of schools in Oregon.
- In addition to funds, having a way to share expertise among schools would benefit those just starting Outdoor School programs.


## The impact of Outdoor School is great as well {.ods-blue}

<blockquote>"Up until Outdoor School, he was a real challenge in the classroom. I connected with him somehow. We got him to the beach. The entire week, he was in awe of the beach. He had never been there. And the kids in the class got to see a different side of him. When he came back from Outdoor School, he had friends. He had a different outlook on school. His grades went up. I told him, ‘now you have to carry this through and graduate!’”</blockquote>
Jodi Beanland, sixth grade teacher at Ferguson Elementary School in Klamath Falls
